# Heart Disease Dataset Overview

This dataset contains medical records of **920 patients** with information related to **heart disease diagnosis**. The data is collected from multiple sources and includes a variety of clinical measurements.

## Data Sources
- Cleveland
- Hungary
- Switzerland
- VA Long Beach

## Key Variables

| Variable     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `id`         | Patient identifier |
| `age`        | Age in years |
| `sex`        | Gender (Male/Female) |
| `dataset`    | Source of the data |
| `cp`         | Chest pain type (`typical angina`, `atypical angina`, `non-anginal`, `asymptomatic`) |
| `trestbps`   | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| `chol`       | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| `fbs`        | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (TRUE/FALSE) |
| `restecg`    | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| `thalch`     | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| `exang`      | Exercise induced angina (TRUE/FALSE) |
| `oldpeak`    | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
| `slope`      | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| `ca`         | Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy |
| `thal`       | Thallium stress test result |
| `num`        | Diagnosis of heart disease (0 = no disease, 1–4 = increasing severity) |

---

## Initial Observations

### Data Completeness
- Several missing values (`NA` or empty cells)
- `ca` and `thal` have substantial missing data
- Some `chol` values are 0 (likely placeholders for missing)

### Demographics
- **Age range:** 28–77 years
- **Gender:** Skewed toward males

### Diagnosis Distribution
- Many patients diagnosed with `num = 0` (no disease)
- Disease severity ranges from 1 to 4 (increasing severity)

### Data Sources
- Data collected from **4 locations**, possibly with **inconsistent protocols**

---

## Potential Analysis Directions

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of variables like **age**, **cholesterol**, **blood pressure**
- Analyze **risk factors** and their relationship to diagnosis (`num`)
- **Gender-based** differences in disease patterns

### Data Cleaning
- Impute or remove **missing values**
- Address `0` values in `chol` (may need replacement)
- **Standardize** and encode categorical variables

### Predictive Modeling
- Predict **presence/severity** of heart disease (`num`)
- Perform **feature importance analysis** to find key clinical indicators

### Comparative Analysis
- Study **inter-dataset variation** (e.g., Hungary vs. Cleveland)
- Analyze **age-related patterns** in diagnosis and severity

## Usage Notes
This dataset is suitable for:
- Supervised learning (classification/regression)
- Exploratory and inferential statistical analysis
- Feature selection studies in medical diagnosis
